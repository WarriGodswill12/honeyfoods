==================================================
7. PAYMENT SYSTEM (APPLE PAY)
==================================================

Primary payment method:
- Apple Pay

Payment principles:
- Apple Pay should be shown as express checkout
- Checkout should be as frictionless as possible
- No unnecessary form fields when Apple Pay is used

Payment flow:
1. Backend creates order with status = PENDING
2. Apple Pay payment is initiated
3. User authorizes payment
4. Payment is verified on backend
5. Order status updated to PAID
6. User redirected to confirmation page

Payment architecture must be abstracted so that
additional payment providers can be added later
without changing checkout UI logic.

==================================================
8. PAYMENT ABSTRACTION (IMPORTANT)
==================================================

Use a provider-based architecture:

PaymentService
- ApplePayProvider (current)
- Future providers (Paystack, Flutterwave, Stripe)

Frontend must NOT depend directly on a specific gateway.

==================================================
9. ADMIN DASHBOARD REQUIREMENTS
==================================================

Admin must be able to:
- Log in securely
- Create a product:
  - Name
  - Price
  - Description
  - Image upload
  - Availability toggle
- Edit or delete products
- View orders:
  - Customer name
  - Phone number
  - Delivery address
  - Ordered items
  - Payment status
  - Order date

Admin UI should be minimal and easy to use.
